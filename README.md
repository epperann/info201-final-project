### Presentation Information:
**Two sentences explaining your top findings:**
We have found that factors such as the GDP of a nation can vary widely between varying levels of happiness. Additionally, factors such as the freedom to make life choices and social support tend to be higher contributing factors.

**Two sentences explaining what you found the most challenging in making your project:**
The most difficult part was determining the best ways to present the data, since each factor is measured differently. Additionally, it was difficult keeping things organized between multiple files and different branches.
